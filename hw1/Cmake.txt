Make is a program that generates build files. Used to build, compile, and package projects. Create a CMakeLists.txt file and use CMake to create a build directory. Run CMake in the build directory to create a build system file. Build and run projects using the created build system.
CMake and Make conduct an incremental build by performing a dependency test. However, CMake reads and analyzes the inside of the source file to identify dependence information on its own.
In addition, the name and dependence of .o files must be explicitly written in Makefile, but CMake does not have to be small.
For example, I will show a CMake format that functions just like the Makefile in /home/lsp20/hw1.
The CMakeLists.txt command creates a Makefile using the CMakeLists.txt command created by ADD_EXECUTABLE (hw1 main.cread.c write.c). If this is executed through the make command, the project is executed.
